# CleanTest - Flutter Test Project: Weather App

## Project Overview
Create a simple weather application that fetches and displays weather data for a given city. The app should use the BLoC pattern for state management and follow clean architecture principles.

## Requirements

1. **UI/UX**:
   - A search bar to enter a city name
   - Display current weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
   - Show a 5-day forecast
   - Implement a simple, clean design with proper error handling

2. **API Integration**:
   - Use a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
   - Implement proper error handling for API requests

3. **State Management**:
   - Use the BLoC pattern for managing application state
   - Implement proper separation of concerns

4. **Clean Architecture**:
   - Organize the project into layers (presentation, domain, data)
   - Use dependency injection for better testability
